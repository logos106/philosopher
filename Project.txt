1. LAMP virtual machine

- Version of the image
LAMP packaged by Bitnami 7.4.25-11  (https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/virtual-machine)

- Import the virtual machine
Import with VMWare Player or VMWare Workstation. I am using VMWare Workstation

- Log in as root
First log in as bitname (bitnami) as it shows. 
Then run #sudo su
And change password using #pass command.


2. GUI Desktop

- Selected KDE 
I went for KDE for the following reason

In terms of performance, KDE Plasma has quick and smooth animations for panels and menus and uses fewer RAM compared to GNOME. 
Applications open promptly, and stay snappy, even under load. GNOME also behaves nicely by default, but it usually uses more RAM and CPU. 
If you have a lower spec system, GNOME might not be the right choice for you.

- Reboot the system
You can log in desktop

4. Demo program
